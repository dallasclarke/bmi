# BMI & Water Intake Calculator App

---

## What will it do?

This app will take the users gender, weight & height in inches to determine their BMI and also give a calculation based on weight and how much water they should be drinking daily. The water intake is set for the minimum amount they need daily to keep from dehydration and will be given in fluid ounces. 

When the user puts in their data it will return a message based on what they put in and give them the calculations. Different calculations will be performed based on gender also. Based on what results return from the user inputs the messages will vary on what message they receive. 

Other calculations based on the information provided by the user will be calculations of what your resting heart-rate should be around and how many calories should be taken in daily.
